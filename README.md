# Microsoft CSharp Course

Create Project: dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject

The command creates the CsharpProjects and TestProject folders for you, and uses TestProject as the name of your .csproj file.

You should see the TestProject folder and two files, a C# program file named Program.cs and a C# project file named TestProject.csproj. The CLI command uses the folder name when it creates to project file (TestProject.csproj). The Program.cs file is the file containing your C# code.

To compile a build of your application: dotnet build

To run your application: dotnet run
